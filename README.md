Cat’s Eye, or Lehsunia, is the powerful gemstone associated with the shadow planet Ketu in Vedic astrology. Known for its unique appearance with a glowing line like a cat’s eye, this stone is deeply connected with spiritual awakening, protection from hidden enemies, and liberation from worldly attachments. It is especially recommended for those undergoing Ketu Mahadasha or Antardasha, helping mitigate its intense effects.

Wearing a Cat’s Eye can help the wearer overcome fears, boost self-confidence, and attain success in speculative activities like gambling, trading, or stock markets. It is also known to offer protection from black magic, accidents, and negative energies. Spiritually, Lehsunia accelerates detachment and inner peace, making it ideal for seekers and spiritual practitioners.

However, due to its strong effects, Cat’s Eye should only be worn after a thorough astrological evaluation. It is usually worn on the middle finger or the ring finger of the right hand in a silver ring on a Tuesday or Saturday after proper energization.
